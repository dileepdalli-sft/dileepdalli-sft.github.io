__________________

TypeScript is a programming language that adds types to JavaScript. 
It allows us to write JavaScript with a set of tools called a type system that can spot potential bugs in, clarify the structure of, and help refactor our code. 
In addition, TypeScript added newer JavaScript language features, such as arrow functions and classes, years before they were added to JavaScript officially.
